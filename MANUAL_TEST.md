```bash
cd "/Users/naveenpattnaik/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/ignitex-3"

### Step 2: Start the Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Open Browser
After you see this message:
```
➜  Local:   http://localhost:8080/
```

**Manually open your browser** and go to:
```
http://localhost:8080
```

### Step 4: Test the Website

- ⚡ Fast loading (1-2 seconds)
- 🎯 Smooth navigation
- 🚀 Quick API responses

## Why This Works
- Dev server runs on port 8080
- All optimizations are active
- Hot reload enabled for testing

## Alternative: Use Network URL
If localhost doesn't work, use the Network URL shown in terminal:
```
➜  Network: http://192.168.1.2:8080/
```

Copy that URL and paste in your browser.
